# StudyForrest population-receptive-field mapping

## About

This repository contains code to perform population-receptive-field (PRF) mapping based on the retinotopic-mapping data from the [StudyForrest](http://studyforrest.org/) project. PRF mapping is a technique to estimate the spatial coordinates and standard deviation of receptive fields of voxels in fMRI data.


## Transforming fMRI data to MNI space

The data from StudyForrest is in a participant-specific space. We want to transform the data to standard MNI space. To do so, we first need to get the data from the `studyforrest-data-aligned` dataset, and then execute `code/warp.sh`. This requires the `applywarp` command from FSL 5.0.
