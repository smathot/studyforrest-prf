## About

This repository contains code to perform population-receptive-field (PRF) mapping based on the retinotopic-mapping data from the [StudyForrest](http://studyforrest.org/) project. PRF mapping is a technique to estimate the spatial coordinates and standard deviation of receptive fields of voxels in fMRI data.


## Dependencies

This code has been developed on Ubuntu 18.04 with FSL 5.0 installed through NeuroDebian. However, all code should run with minor adjustments on any system. The following packages are required:

- Python libraries for numeric computing and neuroimaging:
	- nilearn
	- sklearn
	- nibabel
	- nipy
	- datamatrix
- FSL 5.0


## Step 1: Get input data files from StudyForrest

~~~
datalad get inputs/studyforrest-data-aligned/sub-*/in_bold3Tp2/sub-*_task-retmap*_run-*_bold.nii.gz
datalad get inputs/studyforrest-data-aligned/sub-*/in_bold3Tp2/sub-*_task-avmovie_run-*_bold_mcparams.txt
datalad get inputs/studyforrest-data-templatetransforms/templates/grpbold3Tp2/brain.nii.gz
datalad get inputs/studyforrest-data-templatetransforms/sub-*/bold3Tp2/in_grpbold3Tp2/subj2tmpl_warp.nii.gz
datalad get inputs/studyforrest-data-phase2/stimuli/retinotopic_mapping/*.mkv
datalad get inputs/studyforrest-data-phase2/sub-*/ses-movie/func/sub-*_ses-movie_task-movie_run-*_recording-eyegaze_physio.tsv.gz
~~~

The folder `inputs/videos` should contain the video fragments of forrest gump as used during recording. These are available upon request from the maintainers of the Study Forrest project, but are not included in the repository due to copyright issues.


## Step 2: Transform fMRI data to MNI space

The data from StudyForrest is in a participant-specific space. The scripts below convert this data to MNI space, which is what we will use for the rest of the scripts.

~~~
./code/warp-retmap.sh
./code/warp-movie.sh
~~~


## Step 3: Prepare analyses

The following scripts need to be executed in order. The will generate various intermediate files, which are stored in the `outputs` folder, and which are used by the analysis notebook.

~~~
python3 code/create-prf-maps.py              # -> outputs/prf-matrix.pkl
python3 code/create-luminance-traces.py      # -> inputs/luminance-traces/sub-*/run-*.csv
python3 code/create-pupil-traces.py          # -> inputs/pupil-traces/sub-*/run-*.csv
python3 code/create-correlation-matrices.py  # -> outputs/outputs/correlation-matrix.csv
                                             #    outputs/correlation-matrix.pkl
                                             #    outputs/longish-correlation-matrix.csv   
~~~


### Step 5: Inspect the results

Open `code\main-analysis.ipynb` in JupyterLab/ Jupyter Notebook.
